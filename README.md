# Maze Game
Simple JavaScript maze game created as coursework, contains simple sprites of pickle rick and his portal. The player can navigate a randomly generated maze and reach the exit. The randomly generated maze is achieved by using a recursive backtracking algorithm. This is a port from my C# maze game, this was primarily a way for me to practice my JavaScript while also allowing me to leverage the flexibility of the web technologies to create a decent looking UI.

# Note
the for the png image some glitch may occur in the game so if you are using it make shure to change the image.
